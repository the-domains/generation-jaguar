The Jaguars have signed offensive lineman Jacques Mcclendon and released wide receiver Rasheed Bailey. 

The Jaguars have parted ways with wide receiver Rasheed Bailey. Bailey had virtually no shot at making the team at the extremely deep wide receiver position. 

McClendon is a guy who has spent time with the Jaguars before. In 2013 and 2014 McClendon actually started 5 games for the Jags. At his most recent stop in Miami for the 2015 season, McClendon only dressed for three games. This move comes on the heels of Josh Wells being sidelines with a thumb injury and starting left tackle Kelvin Beachum's knee flaring up. The Jaguars depth at O-line may leave something to be desired, but McClendon will help in that regard, if only a little. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/08860235-2770-40cd-9e3a-2a2b0909fdc2.jpg)

McClendon was released by Miami last week and traditionally plays offensive guard/center, which means he's likely a fill in for Luke Bowanko who is on the PUP list. We'll see what this means for the offensive line moving forward, but it seems to indicate that the Jags were uncomfortable with their interior offensive line depth.
